## All Sorts of Sort

I suck at algorithms. I'll try to implement some to understand how they work.

We should be able to test with `make`

* Benchmark: `make benchmark`
* Test coverage: `make coverage`

I'm sure this could be used for something but I strongly recommend not using this in production.
